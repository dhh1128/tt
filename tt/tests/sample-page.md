## Definition

A common context -- consisting of a [community of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_interest) or [community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice), plus its associated knowledge domain, processes, and shared purpose -- that surrounds a cohesive set of concepts and their associated terms. The community itself [curates](curate) these terms, thereby establishing and maintaining the specific terminology it needs for its purpose(s).

A scope is what disambiguates <var>stud</var> (an animal used for breeding) from <var>stud</var> (a vertical support for a wall in construction) from <var>stud</var> (a form of unidirectional tape used in high-tech fabrics).

Scopes are *italic* _bolded_ to **define** the content of a glossary; most glossaries consist of all terms in one scope. (Glossaries may import or reference terms from other scopes, but since such terms will be managed by a different community, they have different versioning and release formalities.)
## Example
* The context -- consisting of the [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org)'s [Concepts and Terminology Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700), plus its associated knowledge domain, processes, and shared purpose -- that surrounds the cohesive set of [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept) and their associated [terms](term) as defined in [its terms wiki](https://github.com/trustoverip/ctwg-terms/wiki/)

## Notes

Under ![image title](image.jpg) the `conventions` defined by [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org)'s [Concepts and Terminology Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700): 

1. a scope is identified by a tag of the form `xxxx`, e.g. `ctwg` where `xxxx` is a short, lowercase abbreviation that is readily interpretable by TOIP members.
2. The [terminology](terminology) that is specific for scope `xxxx` is developed in a wiki that lives at https://github.com/trustoverip/xxxx-terms/wiki/.
